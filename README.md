Features
HTML & CSS only
A visually accurate representation of Facebook's homepage
Clean and organized code structure
Minimal and neat design, reflecting the original Facebook homepage

Future Improvements
Make the design responsive for mobile and tablet devices
Add interactive elements using JavaScript (login form, etc.)
